# 🕒 Work Hours Tracking System

A lightweight and practical attendance tracking system built with **Python (Streamlit)** and **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**.  
Designed to provide a simple, secure, and user-friendly way to manage daily check-ins, check-outs, vacation days, and work hour tracking.

🌍 **Language:** The application interface is fully in **Hebrew**.

## 🔒 Security (Minimal but intentional)

This project implements foundational security practices:

- 🔑 **Password Hashing**  
  User passwords are never stored in plain text.

- 🔐 **Environment Variables**  
  Sensitive data (database credentials, secrets) are stored in `.env` files and are not exposed in the repository.

- 🚫 **.gitignore protection**  
  Prevents leaking:
  - `.env` files  
  - Python cache files (`__pycache__`, `.pyc`)

> ⚠️ Note: This is an MVP-level security implementation and can be extended further (JWT, RLS, etc).

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Backend & UI:** Python + Streamlit  
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)  
- **DB Connection:** psycopg  
- **Environment Management:** python-dotenv
